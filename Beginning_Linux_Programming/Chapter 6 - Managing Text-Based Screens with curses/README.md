## Compiling with curses
 
The curses library takes its name from its ability to optimize the movement of the cursor and minimize the updates needed on a screen, and hence, reduce the number of characters that need to be sent to a text-based terminal. Although the number of characters output is much less important than it was in the days of dumb terminals and low-speed modems, the curses library survives as a useful addition to the programmerâ€™s toolkit.
