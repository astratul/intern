Introduction
Welcome to Beginning Linux Programming, 4th Edition, an easy-to-use guide to developing programs for
Linux and other UNIX-style operating systems.
In this book we aim to give you an introduction to a wide variety of topics important to you as a developer
using Linux. The word Beginning in the title refers more to the content than to your skill level. We’ve struc-
tured the book to help you learn more about what Linux has to offer, however much experience you have
already. Linux programming is a large field and we aim to cover enough about a wide range of topics to
give you a good “beginning” in each subject.
