# Devices and Modules

In this chapter, we discuss four kernel components related to device drivers and device management:
* Device types—Classifications used in all Unix systems to unify behavior of common devices
* Modules—The mechanism by which the Linux kernel can load and unload object code on demand
* Kernel objects—Support for adding simple object-oriented behavior and a parent/child relationship to kernel data structures
* Sysfs—A filesystem representation of the system’s device tree
